/**
 * An [AnimatedVisibility] which takes into account whether or not the element should actually be
 * animated based on the current state of parent compositions. For example, if an element is loaded
 * fast enough that it is included in the initial composition of the message list, then there is no
 * reason to animate it, but if it comes after the initial composition and would otherwise pop into
 * existence, then it should be animated.
 *
 * This also differs from [AnimatedVisibility] by immediately kicking off the animation if the
 * element needs animation. Specifically, this works well for UX components which tend to be
 * completely excluded from the composition (by passing in null UiData to a parent composable) and
 * are only drawn if the UiData is not null. This composable masks the logic for kicking off that
 * transition.
 *
 * @param value the nullable value to be used for whether or not the content should be displayed. If
 *   the value is non-null, then content will be invoked with it and displayed. If it is null, then
 *   previously displayed content will animate out according to the exit transition before being
 *   removed from the composition.
 * @see [AnimatedVisibility]
